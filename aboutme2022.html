    <p class="p">Hello Everyone! My name is Sally Post and I am 18 years old. I have lived in Piedmont since first grade. Moving just 5 minutes away from my old house in Oakland when we moved to Piedmont.

    I plan to go to Gonzaga University next year and study either education or commununications. I have dreamed of being a teacher since i was a little kid but I've also wanted to go into communications for a really long time, so it's become a har decision.

	Some things I like to do is ride horses, hike, hang out with friends, and bake.</p>
